Here's a list of food stalls and restaurants for spending a vacation in Pondicherry:

French and continental cuisine : Le club, Satsanga, Rendezvous, the courtyard at de L'Orient, le Dupleix are the obvious all time favourites...

and then there is seagulls restaurant by the seashore,a perfect place to have a brunch,the view from the restaurant spreads over to the shores,the harbour and the lighthouse, it is a warming sight!

Plus I should mention the Tantos restaurant in auroville town near kalapet. Well it has got its own reputation with fire-baked pizzas for all occasions.

South/North indian veg fine dining:

If you are looking for some south indian veg fine dining, sadhguru spot in JN street opposite A2B is the best.

Hotel Jayaram in Kamaraj salai has probably the best vegetarian meals in Pondicherry in a fine dining setting.

South indian veg shacks:

The Kofi bar in Rue saint martin street has the best coffee along with good samosas.

South Indian breakfast :

The one and only Indain coffee house in chetty street. If you havent tasted the idli, vada sambhar at seven thirty in the morning, after a stroll by the beach,it will make your day more awesome. The onion tomato oothaapam, bread toast with butter, jam and the omlette sandwich are also delicious here.
