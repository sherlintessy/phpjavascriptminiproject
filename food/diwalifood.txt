Food is such an important cultural aspect in India, a country where the food varies wildly from north to south. 

I have divided the foods to eat by savour vs sweet Diwali snacks as I’m always looking for the savoury!

Diwali Sweets
Mithai
This is a name for all of the Indian sweets and desserts. While sweets are an important part of the culture all year round there are a number of specialty Diwali mithai for the festival.

Chirote
This Diwali food is a light and flaky dessert pastries. Chirote are stuffed with a sugary filling, deep fried, and usually served drizzled with syrup. You can’t go wrong with fried and sweet!
Barfi
Creamy sweets that can be served by themselves or with a selection of other mithai. Barfi are a white creamy square made with condensed milk, sugar and nuts. They are cooked together until they solidify then cut into squares.

Karanji
Small pastry pockets that are stuffed with poppy seeds, grated coconut, sugar, nuts and cardamom. Crescent shaped similar to empanadas, karanji take quite a bit of time to prepare, which is why they are often reserved for special occasions such as Diwali.
Diwali Snacks – Savoury
Samosa
These traditional Indian snacks are common around the region during Diwali. Samosas are small pockets of pastry, usually shaped into a triangle, stuffed with minced meat, peas, lentils and other vegetables.


Mawa Kachori
Mawa is a thick dried milk product common in the area of Rajasthan where these desserts originate. These small pastries are stuffed with a combination of mawa, nuts, cardamom sugar and often drizzled with syrup to serve.
