The 13th question which Payal had no clue about was, “In mythology, who among the following was the ‘bhabhi’ of Sri Krishna?” Options were–Renuka, Sarama, Revati and Swayamprabha. After giving it a thought, Payal decided to quit the show and took home Rs 12,50,000.

Upon quitting, she guessed the answer as Revati which was the correct answer. But she didn’t regret her decision and said given the risk factor she didn’t want to lose after winning a huge amount of money.
