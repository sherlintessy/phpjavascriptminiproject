A 2008 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that almost 21 percent of Ayurvedic medicines purchased over the Internet contained detectable levels of lead, mercury or arsenic. 

However, as Manyam pointed out, the medicines mentioned in the 2008 JAMA study were not linked to a widespread epidemic of poisoning in those who consume Ayurvedic medicine.

"Ayurvedic drugs have been taken for thousands of years, mostly in India, and if the lead in [these medicines] was poisonous, we should have an epidemic of lead poisoning. But we never had anything like that," Manyam said.

In 2012, the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) noted six cases of lead poisoning in pregnant women who had used Ayurvedic medicines containing lead. (Fetal exposure to lead can cause severe problems with neurological development and other prenatal health concerns.)

Lead poisoning and poisoning from other dangerous compounds that have been linked to Ayurvedic medicines could be the result of improper use of such medications or in some cases, such compounds may find themselves into certain Ayurvedic medicines that have been improperly manufactured, according to Manyam.  

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not regulate the herbs or dietary supplements that may be prescribed by Ayurvedic practitioners, according to the University of Minnesota's Center for Spirituality and Healing. Furthermore, there is no official licensing procedure for Ayurvedic practitioners in the United States, according to the NCCAM. 

If you're considering an Ayurvedic treatment, or any other alternative therapies, be sure to speak with your primary care physician or other health care professional. Some Ayurvedic treatments may be dangerous when combined with prescription or over-the-counter medicines.
