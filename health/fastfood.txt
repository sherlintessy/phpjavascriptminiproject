Fast food 'makes you less intelligent'
Fast food can make you less intelligent, according to new research.

A high-fat diet over less than 10 days was found to damage the short-term
 memory of rats used in the experiment from scientists at Oxford University.
The research team studied rats fed a low fat diet, comprising 7.5 per cent
 of calories as fat, and compared them with rats fed a high-fat junk food diet,
 with 55 per cent of calories as fat.
It found that after four days the muscles of the rat on the high-fat diet were
 less able to use oxygen to make energy needed to exercise, causing an increase
 in heart size.
After nine days, the high-fat rats made more mistakes in a maze, taking longer 
to complete it. On the other hand, the low-fat rats were running 50 per cent 
further by this period.
Researchers found increased levels of a protein called uncoupling protein 3 in
 the rats' muscle cells. The protein makes the cells less efficient at using 
oxygen to make the energy required for running.
