Saaho Story: A huge empire in the fictional city of Waaji, crores at stake and too many villains – no one can be trusted. Will the balance of power be restored and can one man do whatever it takes to defeat the bad guys?

Saaho Review: You probably already know the answer to the above question, but writer-director Sujeeth takes you through a maze of twists and turns before he gets there – none of them engaging. Pegged as India’s biggest action thriller, Saaho gets into the action mode pretty early on. The film begins with signature wide angles of massive structures and grim looking men who mean serious business. All through the first half, the film travels through cities trying to connect high stake robberies in Mumbai and the search for a missing black box that holds the key to a fortune. But by the time the ‘interval bang’ rolls around, you kind of already know where this is heading, thanks to on-the-nose dialogues.
Saaho surely delivers well as an action extravaganza with a climax that attempts to compensate for its many flaws. The film’s second half picks up pace, but is marred by a weak narrative that needs constant suspension of disbelief. The hyped up special effects and CGI too lack finesse for a film mounted on such a grand scale.
Sujeeth attempts at a potboiler that fires in any and all directions to entertain the audience. You can also see how the story, despite being predictable, might have sounded good on paper, but the many twists and turns just leave you exhausted than excited. Saaho is an attempt at reinventing a story as old as time, if only the numerous ‘bangs’ managed to land.
