If you are familiar with The Witcher in action, it would be hard to clock ‘Wild Hunt’ as a title. One of the best open-world role-playing games of the decade, on Nintendo’s plucky handheld, that is both a dream come true and something that requires immersive gameplay.
What is it about?

In Wild Hunt, you play a mutant-monster hunter paid to take care of magical and mystical pets, usually ones that eat up entire villages. Geralt — to be played by Henry Cavill in the Netflix series — travels the land in search of his past.

How does it play?

The way the entirety of Wild Hunt’s massive sandbox areas, with all its quests, fit into a playable state on the Switch, is magical. This includes all the expansion content, making this easily hundreds of hours of playtime on those commutes.

The biggest question, ‘does it look any good?’ is legit. The game holds up today graphics-wise. It looks great, only in handheld mode. Just don’t dock it to your TV. There are a few compromises in graphical quality, none too noticeable.

Gameplay does knock down your battery life to under three hours, so be vigilant.

Should you get it?

Wild Hunt normally would require a hefty time commitment, and having it on the Switch makes this one of the best ways to experience this classic.
